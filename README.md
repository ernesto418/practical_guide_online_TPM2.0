# Hello student!

Are you that kind of people that prefer learning doing?

In this set of tutorials we will focused just in doing things with the TPM, explaining just the minimal theory to undertund what you are doing. But remember, it is cybersecurity, never try to do some real application until you completly know what you are doing.


In this serie of practical and explained exercises, you will learn how to use the TPM from creating private keys to create some complex policies like getting access to your secret word just if you have a smartcard, you know your password, and you were using you computer for less than 2 hours.



So... I don't want you to make the loss of time! Start with the first course!
